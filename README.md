# DNLP project 

This repository contains two extensions for the DNLP project. Each subdirectory contains a self-contained module with its own documentation and source code.

## Modules

### 1. [SigCompressor](./SigCompressor)
**Efficient LLM Summarization via Extractive Compression**
A framework that uses the SigExt model to compress text prompts (sentence or phrase level) before feeding them to LLMs like GPT or Mistral, with the aim of reducing the number of tokens in the prompt while maintaining summary quality.


## Repository Organization
*   `SigCompressor/`: Contains the source code, scripts, and specific README for the compression experiment.
